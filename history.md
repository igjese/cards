## Resources

### Barter Goods

During the Roman Kingdom (753 BC - 509 BC), a system of barter served as the primary means of exchange. Essential goods like grain were exchanged directly for tools or woven cloth. This practice likely fostered a sense of cooperation within the nascent Roman community.

Barter wasn't limited to necessities. Skilled artisans could exchange their labor for desired goods. For instance, a carpenter might build furniture in exchange for a tailor's new tunic. Even livestock, such as sheep or goats, could be used for barter, offering flexibility in acquiring necessities and desired items.

However, barter was sometimes impractical, larger transactions cumbersome, and determining the fair value of goods could be difficult. These limitations eventually led to the development of more formalized exchange systems, including the use of unworked bronze ingots (Aes Rude) as a precursor to true coinage.

### Aes Rude

During the Roman Kingdom, aes rude emerged as a rudimentary form of exchange. These were unworked lumps or ingots of bronze, lacking any standardized shape or denomination. While not true coinage, aes rude represented a transitional phase towards a more formalized system.

The use of aes rude offered a more portable and divisible unit of value compared to cumbersome barter goods like grain or livestock. Additionally, the inherent value of bronze offered a more consistent measure compared to bartering disparate items.

Still, the lack of standardized weight and size made determining precise value challenging, while the bulky nature of aes rude remained impractical for smaller transactions.  So later, Aes Signatum was developed, the first true Roman stamped bronze ingot, marking a significant step towards the coinage system that would become a cornerstone of the Roman economy.

### Civil Militia

During the early Roman Kingdom, the primary military force wasn't a professional standing army, but a citizen militia. This system relied on the male citizenry to serve in the military when called upon.  These citizen-soldiers, typically farmers and landowners, were expected to equip themselves with basic arms and armor.

The militia system fostered civic duty and self-reliance, also providing a ready available manpool when military force was needed. It reflected the martial nature of early Roman society. Military service was not just an obligation, but a source of honor and prestige.

However, campaigns disrupted farming and limited training hindered militia's effectiveness. These limitations, coupled with Rome's growing ambitions, would eventually lead to the development of a more professional Roman army during the Republic.

### Centuria

The Centuria served as the basic tactical unit of the early Rome. According to legend, Romulus expected each of the three original Roman tribes to provide ten centuriae (military units of approximately 100 men) of infantry. These consisted of citizen-soldiers, typically farmers and landowners.

Later reforms, traditionally attributed to King Servius Tullius, introduced the adoption of Greek-style hoplite equipment. This led to dominant heavy infantry fighting in phalanx formation. The number of centuriae was doubled as part of these reforms.

Citizen-soldiers were further divided by wealth, which determined the equipment they could afford. Wealthier citizens held higher military status and responsibilities. This wealth-based division extended into newly formed Centuriate Assembly, where Centuriae served as voting units, thus intertwining military service with political influence.

## History Cards

### Romulus

In Roman mythology, twins Romulus and Remus were abandoned as infants on the banks of the Tiber River by order of their uncle, usurper of the city of Alba Longa.  Legend has it they were raised by a she-wolf and later returned to restore their grandfather to the throne.

Romulus and Remus then left to establish their own city, but disagreed on the location, leading to a dispute and Remus's death. Romulus then founded the city of Rome on the Palatine Hill in 753 BC.

Early accounts depict Romulus as a strong leader who established many of Rome's core institutions, including the Senate and the Curiate Assembly. He is also credited with establishing religious practices and military forces that would form the foundation of the Roman Kingdom. Still, historical facts remain a subject of debate.

### Sabine Women

As a new settlement, Rome primarily attracted men seeking a fresh start, who were incidentally not viewed favorably as marriage prospects by neighboring tribes. Faced with a lack of women necessary to establish families and ensure Rome's long-term survival, Romulus devised a plan.

He invited neighboring peoples to a festival. At a prearranged signal, the Romans seized their women, sparking outrage and war. In several battles that followed, the well-prepared Romans emerged victorious. However, the Sabines proved more challenging, nearly capturing Rome itself.

Yet, the women intervened, throwing themselves between the combatants and famously crying out that they shouldn't lose both fathers and husbands on the same day. This led to a truce, ultimately resulting in the unification and joint ruling of Romulus and the Sabine king, with the Sabines settling on the Capitoline Hill.

### Curiate Assembly

The Curiate Assembly (Comitia Curiata) was a cornerstone of Roman government during the era of the Kings (753 to 509 BCE). Organized by ethnic units called "curiae," believed to be originally thirty in number, the Curiate Assembly wielded significant power.

It was composed of male citizens, possibly limited to patricians, the aristocratic families of Rome. The Assembly's vote was required to ratify the selection of kings and magistrates, and to approve laws proposed by the king and the Senate.

These laws, known as leges curiatae, covered a wide range of matters, including criminal justice, property rights, and religious observances. Additionally, the Curiate Assembly held some judicial authority, trying certain offenses, especially those related to breaches of religious law.

### Solar Calendar

The early Roman Kingdom employed a lunar calendar of roughly 10 months, with an imprecise 'winter' period possibly due to its lack of significance for agriculture. According to legend, it was instituted by Romulus.

Yet, such lunar calendar presented a significant challenge for an agricultural society like early Rome.  The discrepancy between the lunar and solar cycles resulted in a calendar that gradually drifted out of sync with the seasons. 

A shift towards a calendar better aligned with the Solar year emerged, with Numa Pompilius adding months of January and February, and Lucius Tarquinius Priscus placing January at the beginning of the year. Regardless of its exact form, Roman calendar remained a work in progress.

### Port of Ostia

Ostia, possibly Rome's first colony, was located directly on the Mediterranean coast at the mouth of the Tiber River. It's founding is attributed to the king Ancus Marcius, for defensive purposes and salt production.

This fort, probably a military outpost since 7th century BCE, likely marked the beginning of Rome's maritime colonies, highlighting the city's growing awareness of the strategic importance of the Tiber's mouth and Mediteranean trade.

In the centuries to come, Port of Ostia will gradually transition to a bustling commercial center, driven by Rome's expanding population and its growing reliance on imports, particularly grain, from across the Mediterranean.  

### Circus Maximus

Religion and entertainment were deeply connected in Roman society. Circus Maximus, a venue for chariot races, was built in a low-lying area between the Palatine and Aventine Hills, a natural valley floor perfect for early racing events.

The valley housed shrines dedicated to earth and grain deities, potentially predating the formal development of the racing track itself. Several temples overlooked the Circus Maximus, including temples dedicated to spring and moon goddesses, among others.  

Evolving from the landscape, then getting wooden seatings first for upper classes and later for common people as well, Circus Maximus will eventually become magnificent structure holding more than 150.000 spectators for the next millenia.

### Servian Wall

First city wall is traditionally attributed to King Servius Tullius (6th century BCE). While literary sources suggest a defensive barrier existed at that time, archaeological evidence points to actual construction in 4th century BCE, after Gaul's sack of Rome during the Republic.

Constructed primarily of volcanic tuff, a readily available and durable material, the Servian Wall stretched for an impressive 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) and it encompassed all seven hills of Rome. It served as Rome's primary defense for centuries.

It reached heights of up to 10 meters (33 feet) in some sections, while its base possessed substantial width. Earthen embankments were built along weaker sections, and some sections incorporated a deep ditch (fossa) in front of the wall. The wall was also outfitted with war machines like catapults, adding another layer of protection.

### Servian Reforms

The Servian Reforms, traditionally attributed to King Servius Tullius (6th century BCE), fundamentally transformed Roman society by introducing a new system of citizenship based on wealth instead of lineage and reorganizing the military, laying the foundation for the Roman social and military structure for centuries.

Reforms introduced a census, that categorized citizens into five social classes based on their wealth, determining not only social status but also tax and military obligations and voting rights in newly established Centuriate Assembly. This ensured that those with the most resources had a greater say in government decisions.

The Servian reforms also reorganized the Roman army into legions, comprised of units (centuries) levied from each class. The wealthiest citizens, equipped by their own means, formed the heavy infantry, while those of lesser means served as lighter troops or provided support services, ensuring a well-equipped and organized military force.

### Centuriate

The Centuriate Assembly (Comitia Centuriata) was a unique voting system, established in 6th century BCE by King Servius Tulius, and responsible for electing officials, passing laws and declaring war. For the first time, both patricians (upper class) and plebians (commoners) could participate.

Voting power was based on wealth and military service. Citizens were divided into five wealth-based classes, each further subdivided into 'centuries' (voting units). Wealthier classes had more centuries, granting them greater influence.

These centuries mirrored the Roman army structure. Centuries were not only voting units but also military units from which soldiers were levied. Wealthier citizens were responsible for their own weapons and equipment, ensuring strong and well-equipped military.

### Temple of Jupiter

Jupiter was the king of Roman gods, wielding power over thunder, lightning, and the sky. His association with rain and fertility made him a central figure in Roman religion. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus ("Jupiter Best and Greatest") stands as the most significant religious structure of the Roman Kingdom.

It's location atop the Capitoline Hill became a sacred space for interpreting the will of the gods through bird observation. Temple also served for significant civic events, such as military triumphs or important pronouncements seeking divine approval. 

While dedicated at first year of the Republic in 509 BCE, it's construction began almost a century earlier, under Etruscan King Tarquinius Priscus. Initially, temple had a single large chamber for the Jupiter statue and terracotta decorations adorning the roof, while elaborate modifications were added later, such as triple chamber for Jupiter, Juno and Minerva.

### King Election

Early Rome was an elective monarchy, ruled by a series of elected leaders. Tradition places the legendary Romulus as the very first king, but the historical record truly begins with his successors. The seventh and last king was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, who usurped power and ruled as a tyrant, leading to his overthrow and the birth of the Roman Republic.

When king died, Rome entered an interregnum. The Senate assumed control and initiated the search for a successor. Appointed Senator, the interrex, held a five-day term solely dedicated to nominating a candidate for king. By observing birds, priests sought the gods' approval, after which nominee needed to be confirmed by both the Senate and the Curiate Assembly, a citizen representative body.

The Roman king acted as a military, civic and religious leader. He commanded the army in war and defense, his decrees held the power of law, and he functioned as the supreme judge in legal matters.

### Military Triumph

A victorious military leader could be granted a 'Triumph' by the Senate. During the regal era it was most commonly king himself. It was a carefully orchestrated ceremony that aimed to boost the victor's reputation, reaffirm the power and prestige of Rome, and to appease the gods.

The returning commander rode into the city on a chariot, adorned with a laurel crown. He was draped in the toga picta, an all-purple, gold-embroidered garment signifying his temporary, quasi-divine status. The procession itself paraded captives and the spoils of war before cheering crowds, showcasing the consequences of defying Roman military might.

The culmination of the triumph occurred at the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill.  Here, the victor offered sacrifices to the king of the Roman gods, ensuring divine favor for Rome's continued success. Public games and festivities followed, funded by the spoils of war.

### Pontifex Maximus

Pontifex Maximus, the highest priest of the College of Pontiffs (Collegium Pontificum), oversaw Rome's religious life. According to legend, the first Pontifex Maximus was Numa Pompilius, the wise and pious second king of Rome, who established many of the city's religious institutions.

This prestigious position wasn't simply a position of religious authority - it wielded significant influence in Roman society. The Pontifex Maximus supervised the public religious ceremonies of the Roman state and interpreted religious omens, to discern the will of the gods and guide the course of action in critical situations. 

Additionally, the Pontifex Maximus maintained the official calendar, marking religious festivals and determining auspicious days for public affairs. Moreover, he was the custodian of Rome's sacred records, which chronicled important events and religious pronouncements. He also possessed the power to veto certain actions deemed religiously unfavorable. 

### Seven Kings

The Roman Kingdom, spanning from 753 to 509 BC, was ruled by a succession of seven kings, who transformed a small settlement into a formidable city-state. They established key Roman institutions and expanded Roman territory through warfare and diplomacy. The traditional narrative credits the city's founding to the legendary first king, Romulus. Following his death, a series of elected kings ruled Rome.   

Each king left his mark on the developing Roman state. Numa Pompilius established many religious institutions. Tullus Hostilius was known for his military prowess. Ancus Marcius expanded Roman territory. Tarquinius Priscus is credited with major construction projects, including Circus Maximus and the Temple of Jupiter. Servius Tullius implemented social and military reforms. 

The final king, Tarquinius Superbus, is portrayed as a tyrant whose reign ultimately led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Roman Republic.

### Vestal Virgins

In ancient Rome, the Vestal Virgins were priestesses that tended the eternal flame of Vesta, goddess of the hearth, home, and family. Dating back to the 7th century BC, this cult of Vesta and its dedicated priestesses played a significant role in Roman religion for a millenium.

Small girls from prominent families were meticulously chosen for this duty by the Pontifex Maximus. Once chosen, they embarked on a thirty-year service dedicated to chastity and devotion to Vesta. Only six priestesses served at a time.

Vestal Virgins enjoyed a privileged status within Roman society. They held positions of high respect and were considered untouchable. However, their lives were also highly restricted, and any transgression could lead to harsh punishment, including execution. The Vestal Virgins remained a cornerstone of Roman religion until the rise of Christianity in the 4th century AD.

### Roman Sewers

The Cloaca Maxima was one of the world's earliest sewage systems. The construction of the Cloaca Maxima is attributed to King Tarquinius Priscus around 600 BCE, who employed Etruscan workers and plebeians for the task. The initial purpose was to transform the swampy area near the Roman Forum into solid building ground.

It expanded upon a network of existing drainage ditches, by lining an existing streambed with stone. Eventually, this open channel evolved into a vaulted system constructed from volcanic stone.

Over time, the sewer was expanded and renovated, with sections covered and transformed into a robust underground system. The use of gutters and conduits ensured efficient water flow, while vaulted structures with flat panels or rocks provided stability. The sewer continued to be well-maintained throughout eras and even functions to some degree today.

### Etruscan Peers

A powerful civilization, the Etruscans, flourished north of Rome in a region called Etruria. They spoke a non-Indo-European language, completely distinct from Latin or other Italic languages.

Trade with the Etruscans and their cultural influence were very important for early Rome. The Romans adopted Etruscan methods in urban planning and construction techniques. Several Roman kings were believed to be Etruscans. Moreover, Roman religion incorporated many Etruscan deities and rituals. However, the relationship between Etruscans and Romans wasn't solely cultural. 

Etruscan city-states sometimes formed alliances with Rome, particularly against common enemies like the Gauls.  However, there were also periods of conflict. The Romans engaged in protracted wars against Etruscan cities like Fidenae and Veii. Over time, through a combination of warfare, alliances, and cultural integration, the Etruscans were gradually assimilated into the Roman world.

### Latin League

The Latin League was a relatively loose alliance of communities within the Latium region, bound together by shared ancestry and language (Latin), and common pantheon of deities. According to some accounts, the city of Alba Longa held leadership within the league. 

The relationship between the Latin League and Rome was one of mixed cooperation and conflict. Throughout the Roman Kingdom period, numerous disputes and wars erupted between Rome and individual Latin cities, and occasionally with the entire league.  

While dominant early on, the increasing power of Rome gradually eroded the league's autonomy, and later during Roman Republic, it will eventually be absorbed into the Roman sphere of influence.

### Magna Graecia

Magna Graecia wasn't a single unified entity, but rather a collection of independent Greek city-states (poleis) scattered along the southern coast of Italy and Sicily, flourished from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE not only due to its fertile land but also because of its strategic location.  

Prominent cities like Syracuse, Tarentum, and Sybaris became centers of trade, agriculture, and cultural activity. Greek colonists established trade routes connecting them to the Etruscan cities in central Italy, the Phoenician centers in the Mediterranean, and their own kin in mainland Greece. This commercial activity facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural influences.

Artistic styles and intellectual traditions, as well as the adoption of the Greek alphabet by Etruscans and Romans, highlights the profound impact and lasting legacy of Magna Graecia on the development of Roman civilization.

## Action Cards

### Grain Harvest

The grain harvest was pivotal to Rome's survival and stability, providing the staple diet for its population. This agricultural cycle not only fed the city but also influenced Rome's economic policies and social stability.

### Roman Gods

Rome's diverse pantheon, from Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to Minerva, governed every aspect of life and the cosmos, deeply intertwining with state functions and daily existence. These deities represented the societal values, fears, and aspirations of the Roman people.

### Plebeians

The plebeians, encompassing Rome's working and lower classes, played a fundamental role despite initial political exclusion. Their collective struggles for rights and reforms led to significant societal changes, gradually transforming Rome's political landscape.

### Patrician Clans

The patricians, Rome's aristocratic families, claimed descent from the city's earliest senators, holding sway over its political, religious, and social spheres. Their privileged status underscored the social hierarchies and dynamics of early Roman society.

### Seven Hills

Rome, traditionally founded on the Palatine Hill in 753 BC, expanded to include strategic and religious sites like the Capitoline Hill. During the Kingdom period, it grew to encompass the Seven Hills, draining marshes to combat malaria and create public spaces like the Roman Forum. This expansion laid Rome's foundational structure, establishing early boundaries and the urban layout pivotal to its historical development.

### Agriculture

Fertile land around early Rome provided wheat, olives, grapes, and livestock. Cultivation and animal husbandry were intertwined with religious observances, reflecting the societal reverence for farming. Land ownership was a key indicator of status within the patrician class, highlighting the social importance of agriculture. 

### Regional Trade

Strategically situated along the Tiber River and with the establishment of the nearby Port of Ostia, Rome gradually became a commerce hub. Initially trading with neighboring Etruscans and Latin tribes, it soon extended commerce to Greek colonies further south. Key exports included agricultural staples like wheat, olives, and wine.  The flow of goods and cultural exchanges embedded diverse influences into the fabric of Roman society, setting the stage for its later expansion and cultural synthesis.

### River Tiber

The Tiber River was a lifeline for the early city of Rome during the Roman Kingdom (753 BC - 509 BC). Flowing through central Italy, the Tiber provided a vital transportation route. Ships could travel upriver for about 60 miles, carrying grain, timber, and stone. This easy access to trade helped Rome become a center of commerce.

But the Tiber offered more than just transportation. Its seasonal flooding made the surrounding land fertile. This rich soil, perfect for growing crops, helped sustain the growing Roman population.

The river also marked a natural boundary. The western bank belonged to the Etruscans, while the eastern side housed the Latins and Sabines. These neighbors interacted with the Romans through trade, but sometimes through conflict. To control access across the water, the Romans built several bridges. These bridges became not just transportation links, but symbols of Roman power and influence.

### Magistrates

Magistrates in the Roman Kingdom held roles that directly impacted daily life and governance. They enforced laws, managed city finances, led military units, and presided over courts and public ceremonies. These officials ensured the community functioned smoothly, from public safety to religious observances. Their work under the king was the early framework of Rome's legal system, setting precedents for public administration.

### Latin Language

Within early Rome, Latin was the official and dominant language. It was used in daily life, legal matters, official documents, and religious ceremonies. This shared tongue helped unify the diverse communities within the city.

However, Latin wasn't the only language spoken in the region. Etruscan, a still partially-understood language, was spoken by Rome's powerful neighbor to the north. Italic languages like Oscan and Umbrian were also prevalent among other neighboring communities.

While major conquests wouldn't come until the Republic, Rome's early local expansion brought Latin into contact with these languages.  Latin likely wasn't spoken by all Romans in the Kingdom period, but its use in official spheres and its gradual spread through interaction with neighboring communities laid the groundwork for its future dominance.

### Saturnalia

Saturnalia, honoring Saturn, reversed social norms in a period of feasting and festivity, embodying themes of renewal and equality. This festival reflects the societal and agricultural significance of Saturn, celebrating the end of the planting season with merriment and social upheaval.

### Private Schools

In the Republic, private schooling provided the children of the elite with education in literacy, rhetoric, and moral philosophy, preparing them for leadership roles. This system underscores the value placed on education and civic preparedness in Roman society.

### Military Outposts

Established in newly conquered areas, military outposts secured Roman authority and facilitated regional administration. These garrisons were instrumental in Rome's strategic defense and expansion, marking the empire's advancing frontiers.

### Roman Phalanx

The Roman phalanx, a military formation borrowed and adapted from the Greeks, was crucial for Rome's early military engagements. Comprising closely arrayed soldiers armed with spears and shields, it highlighted Rome's tactical adaptability, later giving way to the more flexible manipular formation.

### Urban Prefect

The Urban Prefect, appointed to manage Rome's internal affairs, particularly in the absence of military leaders, underscored the importance of maintaining civic order, justice, and administrative oversight within the burgeoning metropolis.

### Debt Bondage

Debt bondage, where individuals pledged service as loan collateral, was prevalent in early Rome, often leading to abuse and social unrest. This practice drove the plebeian struggle for legal and social reforms, highlighting the economic disparities and tensions within Roman society.

### Palatine Hill

Palatine Hill, fabled as the location of Rome's foundation by Romulus, became the residence of its emperors and nobility, symbolizing the city's political and religious core. This hill embodies Rome's historical and mythological roots, serving as a focal point for its founding legends.

### Roman Senate

The Roman Senate, composed of the republic's most experienced and esteemed citizens, functioned as a pivotal advisory body. Influencing legislation, foreign policy, and fiscal affairs, the Senate played a critical role in Rome's governance, exemplifying the power of wisdom and tradition.

### Public Forum

The Roman Forum stood at the heart of Roman social, political, and economic activity, hosting public discourse, legal proceedings, elections, and trade. As the epicenter of public life, it symbolized the vibrancy of the Roman polity and its civic culture.

### Mars

Mars, venerated as both the god of war and protector of agriculture, embodies the dual essence of Roman divinity, integrating martial valor with the fertility of the land. As the mythical father of Romulus and Remus, Mars is central to Rome's foundational myths and civic religion.

## Victory Sequence

### Tyrant Exile

The expulsion of Tarquin the Proud, Rome's last king, due to tyrannical rule, marked the transition from monarchy to republic. This shift was driven by a collective desire to prevent the concentration of power, leading to the establishment of a more balanced governmental structure.

### Dual Consuls

Replacing monarchical rule, the introduction of dual consuls in the early Republic ensured shared executive power. Elected annually, these consuls embodied the republican principle of divided authority, serving as both military commanders and chief administrators, mitigating the risks of tyranny.

### Regillus Victory

The Battle of Lake Regillus, a foundational victory against the Latin League, underscored Roman military capability and the perceived support of deities like Castor and Pollux. This victory not only bolstered Rome's military reputation but also reinforced its divine protection and martial spirit.
