ok, now I want that starting a game introduces basic concepts to player, in animated "steps" like this:
1. resource cards are being dealt, while sound effect is being played, and text is displayed under them "Buy resources"
2. action cards are being dealt, with sound effect, and text is added " and actions..."
3. player's hand is being dealt, with sound effect, and new text is added "... to improve your deck"

how do I do that? overall approach and step1 details should be quite enough for the moment


What I'm thinking:

I have enum with states START1,START2,START3

new_game should set state to START1 and call deal_resources()

deal_resources() should prepare array of cards to be dealt, call deal_card() for each, and when all are dealt move state to START2

deal_card() should show animation and play sound, when done call refresh_all()

refresh_all() should hide/show elements based on state

something like that?
