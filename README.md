# "Chronicles: Roman Empire" - Game Design Document

## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

- Gameplay: Aims to play like Dominion, but single player. 
- Educational aspect: Each new game can highlight a single card (e.g. Julius Caesar, or Roman Legions) and provide interesting but accurate historical information. (intro screen, player needs to click "continue" to proceed)
- Solo games, examples
    - Gate: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/gate1
    - Friday: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43570/friday

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use GPT to create visuals.
- Use Godot to develop a product.
- Keep as close to Dominion formula as we can.


## Gameplay

Going in stages corresponding to historical periods, the first is founding of Rome and kingdom, ending with battle of Lake Regillus.

For treasure cards: Maybe have only money for the first period, later adding army, and only in the last one adding provisions (as another type of progression from lean and simple into complex and vast).

Example cards for the first period:
