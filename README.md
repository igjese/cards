# "Chronicles: Roman Empire" - Game Design Document

## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

- Gameplay: Aims to play like Dominion, but single player. 
- Educational aspect: Each new game can highlight a single card (e.g. Julius Caesar, or Roman Legions) and provide interesting but accurate historical information. (intro screen, player needs to click "continue" to proceed)
- Solo games, examples
    - Gate: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/gate1
    - Friday: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43570/friday

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use GPT to create visuals.
- Use Godot to develop a product.
- Keep as close to Dominion formula as we can.


## Gameplay

Going in stages corresponding to historical periods, the first is founding of Rome and kingdom, ending with battle of Lake Regillus.

For treasure cards: Maybe have only money for the first period, later adding army, and only in the last one adding provisions (as another type of progression from lean and simple into complex and vast).

Example cards for the first period:

| Title              | Reason                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------|

### Ideas for Republic

Early Republic vs Late Republic

Victory sequence:
Marius
Sula
Caesar Civil War
Assasination of Caesar

## Old / Obsolete (just for reference or re-use)

### Gameplay
1. Player starts with 10 cards in a deck. Starting deck is 1x Italy (territory), 2x Centuriae (army), 3x Grain (provisions), 5x Sestertii (money)
2. Each turn next history card is drawn, while player is dealt new hand of 5 cards
3. Player has 1 action available and plays action cards
4. Effects are accumulated (treasures etc)
5. Player can buy one card (unless some effect specify differently)
6. Game proceeds to next round
7. Player wins when acquiring all territory cards.

- Endgame: game needs some kind of climax. Ideas: barbarian invasions, final battle, final conquest like Persia or "Known World, something (clear and clymactic end) - maybe when you take all, there is single win-or-lose round or something (might make sense because you are never forced to conquer last territories, so you choose the time)
- Missing: not sure whether to include "collapse stuff" in (4 tribunes, split, Constantinople, two sacks of Rome...)
- Loss aversion: maybe sholdn't lose territory, do some other penalty instead
- Alternative: game goes in chronological stages, with separate History and Territory (maybe even Action?) cards for each stage.

### Tresure cards
- There are three types of treasure: money, provisions and army. Each of tresure cards have their own pile.

| Type        | Card Name   | Cost              | Provides     | Notes                        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Money       | Sestertius  | 0$                | 1$           | Basic currency unit          |
| Money       | Denarius    | 3$                | 2$           | Intermediate currency unit   |
| Money       | Aureus      | 6$                | 3$           | High-value currency unit     |
| Provisions  | Grain       | 2$                | 1 provision  | Basic sustenance resource    |
| Provisions  | Olive Oil   | 3$                | 2 provisions | Mid-level resource           |
| Provisions  | Wine        | 4$                | 3 provisions | High-level resource          |
| Army        | Centuriae   | 1$ + 1 provisions | 1 army       | Basic military unit          |
| Army        | Cohort      | 5$ + 3 provisions | 3 army       | Intermediate military unit   |
| Army        | Legion      | 9$ + 5 provisions | 5 army       | Advanced military unit       |
