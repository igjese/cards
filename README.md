# Chronicles: Roman Empire - Game Design Document

## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

## Gameplay
Based on Dominion paradigm, but single player. 
- To aim more at "solitaire-like" experience.
- To allow (maybe) for more lenghty games, maybe different campaign types that vary in expected game length.

## Educational Aspect
Each new game can focus on a single card (e.g. Julius Caesar, or Roman Legions) and provide basic but accurate historical information.

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use GPT to create visuals.
- Use Godot to develop a product.
