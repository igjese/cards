# "Chronicles: Roman Empire" - Game Design Document

## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

- Gameplay: Aims to play like Dominion, but single player. 
- Educational aspect: Each new game can focus on a single card (e.g. Julius Caesar, or Roman Legions) and provide interesting but accurate historical information.

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use GPT to create visuals.
- Use Godot to develop a product.
- Keep as close to Dominion formula as we can.

## Gameplay
- Player starts with 10 cards in a deck, each hand is 5 cards
- Starting deck is 1x Italy (territory), 2x Centuriae (army), 3x Grain (provisions), 5x Sestertii (money)
- Player wins when acquiring all territory cards.

## Territory cards
- Territory cards are in 3 piles, with only top card being available/visible.
