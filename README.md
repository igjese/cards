# "Chronicles: Rise of Rome" - Game Design Document

## Summarized design discussion Sep-12 2024

### Player and Enemy Representation
- Player is represented by a **single Roman figure**.
- Enemies (e.g., Caenina, Crustumerium, Antemnae) are represented by **tribal figurines**.
- **Next action** is shown above each enemy (e.g., attack Fortune, call reinforcements).
- **Enemy Tooltip**: Displays enemy **Battle Strength**, **next action**, and **what can be done** to them (e.g., “Bribe with 1 more Money card”).
- **Player Tooltip**: Displays **Fortune shield status**, remaining actions, and what actions the player can take (e.g., "Drag Money to shield Fortune").
 
### Player Actions:
- **Attack**: Dragging an Army card to an enemy reduces its **Battle Strength** by Army value of the card.
- **Bribe**: Bribing an enemy requires **2 Money cards**. 
  - Dragging the first Money card to an enemy shows a **gold icon** above their head, indicating they can be bribed with one more Money card.
  - Once the second Money card is dragged, the bribe succeeds, and the enemy’s Battle Strength decreases by 1.
- **Defend**: 2 Money cards are required to create a shield for player's Fortune.
  - A **shield icon** appears after the second card.
  - **Shields last until broken** by an enemy attack, and **shields can be stacked** for additional protection.

### Enemy Actions:
- **Attack**: Reduces the player's **Fortune** by 1 or breaks 1 shield if present.
  - When an enemy attacks, the figure **swells** or **pulses**, with an attack effect (e.g., a red line or icon hitting the Fortune counter or the shield if it's active).
- **Reinforce**: Increases the tribe's **Battle Strength** by 1.
  - When an enemy calls reinforcements, the figure **glows** or **swells slightly**, with their strength number increasing.
- Other attack types to be used by later enemies:
  - **Reduce Actions**: Lowers the player's available actions next turn by 1.
  - **Force Discard**: Randomly discards 1 card from the player's hand.

### Cards:
- **Army Cards**: Used to attack enemies and reduce their Battle Strength.
- **Money Cards**: Used to bribe enemies or build defenses to protect Fortune. 
- **Action Cards**: Provide normal resources (money, army) and tactical bonuses such as drawing extra cards or gaining extra actions.
  - **Roman Phalanx**: Provides 2 Army value.  
  - **Grain Harvest**: Provides 2 Money value.  
  - **Patrician Clans**: Provides 1 Army value and gains 1 extra action.  
  - **Plebs**: Draw 2 cards and gain 1 extra action.  
  - **Regional Trade**: Provides 1 Money value and draws 1 card.    

#### Turn Mechanics:
- Each battle turn consists of the player performing up to 3 actions, followed by enemy actions (single action per enemy).
- Battles continue until all enemies' Battle Strength is reduced to 0 (**Victory**) or the player’s Fortune reaches 0 (**Failure**)
- After both player and enemy have taken their actions, a new turn begins:
  - **Player draws 3 cards** at the start of each turn.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Fortune** is a carry-over resource, represented in Roman numerals on the top dashboard, and persists between encounters.
- Each **encounter** consists of multiple steps, with each step presenting a short historical snippet (2-3 sentences).
- The **deck**, **hand**, and **discard pile** carry over between encounters, allowing for long-term resource management.
- **Trashed cards** are permanently removed from the game.


## Implementation Sep-9 2024

- Fortune counter/badge on map screen and encounter screen
- Encounter: player's hand, deck, discard pile 
- Encounter: player's hand "expands/shrinks" based on number of cards
- Encounter: Deck browsing, discard pile browsing
- Map: visuals instead of icons for resolved encounters
- Browsing hand, deck, discard pile from the Map screen (maybe it could make sense to have them on the bottom at all times, but they expand/minimize when on-hovered)
- offering options 
- data model for options for each encounter
- choosing options (including animations)
- playing a card from hand (including animations)
- playing a card from deck, trashing a card (incl.anim.)
- drawing a card, reshuffling the deck (incl.anim.)
- discarding a card (incl.anim.)
- data model for turns, hand, deck, discard pile, trash pile, fortune, available actions
- data model for cards (specify what player can do with them)
- data model for encounters (steps, options, actions, and outcomes)
- Data model for enemies (visual, strength indicators, attack types).
- player battle moves (attack enemy, bribe enemy, defend fortune)
- enemy battle moves (attack fortune, reinforce, reduce player actions, force discard)
- AI rules for computer turn in battle
- state machine for battle
- encounter victory / failure
- tutorial / onboarding / hand-holding
- fortune balancing

TODO:
- implement action cards => which actions ?!?
- encounter system with steps
- event system with options and outcomes
- battle system

### Battle Mechanics Sep-7 2024

- **Player Starts** with 5 cards in hand and 3 actions per turn (due to 3 enemy tribes).
- **Player Turn**:
  - **Play up to 3 actions**:
    - **Army cards**: Reduce an enemy tribe's **Battle Strength** by 1 per card.
    - **2 Money cards (1 action)**:
      - **Bribe**: Lowers an enemy tribe's **Battle Strength** by 1.
      - **Build Defenses**: Blocks 1 **Fortune loss** from enemy attacks for 2 turns.
    - **Action cards**: Provide tactical effects, such as drawing extra cards, negating enemy reinforcements, or boosting Army/Money effects.
  - **Spend 1 Fortune** to draw an extra card or take an additional action.

- **Enemy Turn**:
  - First battle is against 3 tribes
  - Each tribe randomly performs one of two actions:
    - **Attack Fortune**: Reduces the player's **Fortune** by 1.
    - **Call Reinforcements**: Increases the tribe's **Battle Strength** by 1.
  - **Later enemies** can also perform:
    - **Reduce Actions**: Lowers the player's available actions next turn by 1.
    - **Force Discard**: Randomly discards 1 card from the player's hand.

- **Card Draw**: At the start of each turn, the player **draws 3 cards**.

- **End Condition**:
  - **Victory**: Reduce all enemy tribes' **Battle Strength to 0**.
  - **Failure**: The player's **Fortune reaches 0** or they run out of viable resources to act.


## Encounters Sep-7 2024

- **Card Draw**: At the start of each encounter, the player draws enough cards to have 5 in hand (e.g., if 3 cards remain, 2 more are drawn).
- **Encounter Steps**: Most encounters consist of multiple steps, each offering different options that require resources (Army, Money, or Fortune).
- **Battle Encounters**: Battle encounters follow a 3-step structure:
  1. **Pre-Battle**: Preparation with choices or actions.
  2. **Battle**: Core battle mechanics (separate from other encounters).
  3. **Post-Battle**: Aftermath with rewards or consequences.
- **Origins** encounter is the game starting screen (when player clicks "Play"), resolution opens the map

## Gameplay Sep-6 2024

- **Fortune** is a carry-over resource, represented in Roman numerals on the top dashboard, and persists between encounters.
- Each **encounter** consists of multiple steps, with each step presenting a short historical snippet (2-3 sentences).
- A step can either be a **battle** (resolved through cards) or offer **options** (choices based on Army, Money, or Fortune).
- The **deck**, **hand**, and **discarded pile** carry over between encounters, allowing for long-term resource management.
- Under certain circumstances (such as **failure** or specific options), a card can be **permanently trashed**, removing it from the deck permanently.
- **Encounter Steps** can be resolved either by playing cards from the deck or choosing between different options.
- **Army** and **Money cards** are played directly or replaced with **Action cards** that generate resources without losing the card.
- **Rewards** for completing steps can include Fortune, new cards, or other benefits.
- **Player Choices**: When a player chooses to spend **Fortune**, it's deducted from their Fortune total. Playing Army or Money cards results in those cards going to the **discard pile** (unless they use an Action card, which preserves the resource).
- **Carry-Over Mechanic**: If a card is **discarded**, it remains in the discard pile and can return to the player’s deck when reshuffled. **Trashed cards** are permanently removed from the game.
- **Visual Layout**: Each encounter has a **single visual** that stays consistent through multiple steps to reduce complexity.- **Each encounter type** (Event, Battle, Treasure, Shop, Rest) has a unique **icon** representing it
- The player can choose the **next encounter** from a map, similar to the approach used in "Slay the Spire."
- **After completing an encounter**, the encounter's **icon** is replaced on the map with a **smaller version** of the encounter's **main visual** (to mark it as completed).


## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

- Gameplay: Aims to play like Dominion, but single player.
- Examples: Slay the Spire, Balatro
- Historical flavor: Interesting but accurate historical information

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use pen-and-paper cards to prototype
- Use GPT to create visuals, in "Pompeii fresco" style for uniformity
- Use Godot to develop a product
- For card-set: clone Dominion
- For implementation: clone Slay the Spire

## Historical flavor
Educational specific mechanics:
- Game progresses in chronological stages corresponding to historical periods
- Make cards for each stage reflect economy, culture, military, religion, everyday life for that stage
- Have short (two paragraphs) "popular-history" text for each card when selected
- Have "card of the day" show-cased when starting a game

Historical stages, each with their own decks, are:
1. Kingdom
2. Early and mid Republic
3. Late Republic
4. Early Empire
5. Mid and late Empire

## Learning curve and progression:
1. Start simple (kingdom, stage 1): only 2 cards for money and army each, cards have only basic effects 
2. Increase strategic complexity (republic, stages 2-3): 3 cards for money and army each, some advanced effects
3. Increase management overhead (empire, stages 3-4): additional 3 "provisions" cards, complex effects

## Gameplay

Resource Types:
- During an encounter: Money, Army
- Carries over between encounters: Gold

Card types:
- Resource cards: provide Money or Army units
- Action cards: Perform special actions like drawing more cards, gaining additional actions, or providing bonuses.

Map:
- Encounters in a node graph
- Player progresses bottom-to-top

Encounter types:
- **Event**: Specific requirements or challenges that need to be overcome using Money or Army.
- **Battle**: Defeat enemy cards by reducing their Money or Army stat to zero.
- **Shop**: Spend Gold to buy new cards or upgrades.
- **Rest**: Recover resources or draw additional cards.
- **Treasure**: Gain valuable rewards or rare cards.

### Encounter Mechanics
Each battle and some events have cards that need to be destroyed to win.

Example cards:
- **"Army Provisions"**: Requires 2 Money to overcome.
- **"Building Materials"**: Requires 3 Money.
- **"Civil Unrest"**: Requires 1 Army units.
- **"Military Escort"**: Requires 2 Army units.

### Prayers Mechanic
Cost:
  - **Gold**: Prayers could cost Gold.
  - **Resource Cards**: Prayers could be triggered by sacrificing Money or Army cards from the hand.
  - **Sacrificing Cards**: Players could sacrifice any card to perform a prayer.

Effects:
  - **Additional Actions**: Gain more actions to play more cards in a turn.
  - **Draw More Cards**: Draw additional cards.
  - **Replace a Card**: Discard and draw a new card.

### Pressure Mechanics
- Card Trashing: After each turn, one random card from the player's deck is permanently trashed for the rest of the encounter.
- Scaling Enemy: A specific card gains stats each turn, forcing the player to destroy it quickly.

1. Kingdom
2. Early/mid republic

More: Seven Hills, First Aquaduct, Origins (Troy, Alba Longa), Pater Familias

Maybe: Divide history cards into two periods, so they are not completely random - then second period cards could be more challenging for example
