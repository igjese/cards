# "Chronicles: Rise of Rome" - Game Design Document

## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

- Gameplay: Aims to play like Dominion, but single player. 
- Educational aspect: Each new game can highlight a single card (e.g. Julius Caesar, or Roman Legions) and provide interesting but accurate historical information. (intro screen, player needs to click "continue" to proceed)
- Solo games, examples
    - Gate: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/gate1
    - Friday: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43570/friday

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use pen-and-paper cards to prototype
- Use GPT to create visuals, in "Pompeii fresco" style for uniformity
- Use Godot to develop a product
- Keep as close to Dominion formula as we can

## Mechanics

Solitaire specific mechanics:
- Use additional "history" deck to provide random help and challenge during the game, both for education and replayability
- Use victory cards as culmination and real challenge
- Trash player's cards when not able to overcome history/victory cards, to put mild pressure to finish the game

Educational specific mechanics:
- Game progresses in chronological stages corresponding to historical periods
- Make cards for each stage reflect economy, culture, military, religion, everyday life for that stage
- Have short (two paragraphs) "popular-history" text for each card when selected
- Have "card of the day" show-cased when starting a game

Historical stages, each with their own decks, are:
1. Kingdom
2. Early and mid Republic
3. Late Republic
4. Early Empire
5. Mid and late Empire

Player learning curve and progression:
1. Start simple (kingdom, stage 1): only 2 cards for money and army each, cards have only basic effects 
2. Increase strategic complexity (republic, stages 2-3): 3 cards for money and army each, some advanced effects
3. Increase management overhead (empire, stages 3-4): additional 3 "provisions" cards, complex effects

## Gameplay

Decks are:
- 10 action card same-card decks (chosen at random). Five cards available in each
- History deck, shuffled to be random. Ends with victory cards in precise order.
- Treasure same-card decks (differ for each stage)
- Player's deck of 10 cards (7 basic money and 3 basic army)

Game flow:
1. Player draws five cards. When no cards are available, discarded cards are reshuffled and become new deck.
2. Player can play action cards from his hand (1 by default) with immediate effect.
3. At end of turn he must "overcome" a top history card. If successful, top history card is trashed. If not then top card from player's deck (or discarded deck) is trashed.
4. Player can buy action cards (1 by default).
5. Player discards used cards.

When all victory cards (last cards in history deck) has been "overcome", player wins this stage.

## Game Loops, Cues and Feedback

###  New game: tips

On screen tips when starting the game, uncovering one by one (other parts of the screen are hidden/blacked out):
1. buy resources - and actions (deals these decks, audio effect)
2. to improve your deck (deals players hand, audio effect)
3. and overcome all events until victory (deals history deck, audio)

### Progress - overall
Cues: 
- progress counter x/N on the history deck (current history card / total num of history cards)
- game phase indicator for early history / late history / victory sequence (eg. screen border green, than yellow, then red)

### Progress - current turn

Cues:
- history card should be indicating whether it has been overcome or not. E.g. red exclamation/warning icon jumping and wiggling, turns into green checkbox with audio cue
- there should be clear indicator how many money/army more you need

### What to do

Cue: Hint text that wiggles (or something) whenever it changes, with audio cue

### Playable actions

Cues:
- valid action cards should glow green when player should pick actions to play
- it should be clear how many actions player CAN play

### Buyable cards

Cues:
- valid buyable card should glow green when player should pick cards to buy 
- it should be clear how much money player has available
- it should be clear how many cards player CAN buy

### Player drawing a card / Dealing cards

Cues:
- sound of dealing a card
- animation: card going into its slot

### Play action card

Feedback:
- animation, card moves in its slot
- sound for card moving
- Effects activated one by one: money, army, action, buy (sound + badge wiggling or popping)

### New history card

More: Seven Hills, First Aquaduct, Origins (Troy, Alba Longa), Pater Familias

Maybe: Divide history cards into two periods, so they are not completely random - then second period cards could be more challenging for example
