# "Chronicles: Roman Empire" - Game Design Document

## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

- Gameplay: Aims to play like Dominion, but single player. 
- Educational aspect: Each new game can highlight a single card (e.g. Julius Caesar, or Roman Legions) and provide interesting but accurate historical information. (intro screen, player needs to click "continue" to proceed)

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use GPT to create visuals.
- Use Godot to develop a product.
- Keep as close to Dominion formula as we can.

## Gameplay
1. Player starts with 10 cards in a deck. Starting deck is 1x Italy (territory), 2x Centuriae (army), 3x Grain (provisions), 5x Sestertii (money)
2. Each turn next history card is drawn, while player is dealt new hand of 5 cards
3. Player has 1 action available and plays action cards
4. Effects are accumulated (treasures etc)
5. Player can buy one card (unless some effect specify differently)
6. Game proceeds to next round
7. Player wins when acquiring all territory cards.

## Tresure cards
- There are three types of treasure: money, provisions and army. Each of tresure cards have their own pile.
