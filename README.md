# "Chronicles: Rise of Rome" - Game Design Document

## Goal
Goal is to create Solitaire Deck Building game that educates the player about Roman era. If successful, I can continue doing this into my retirement.

- Gameplay: Aims to play like Dominion, but single player.
- Examples: Slay the Spire, Balatro
- Historical flavor: Interesting but accurate historical information

## Implementation
Cheapest possible, since the whole idea is to do this solo.
- Use pen-and-paper cards to prototype
- Use GPT to create visuals, in "Pompeii fresco" style for uniformity
- Use Godot to develop a product
- For card-set: clone Dominion
- For implementation: clone Slay the Spire

## Historical flavor
Educational specific mechanics:
- Game progresses in chronological stages corresponding to historical periods
- Make cards for each stage reflect economy, culture, military, religion, everyday life for that stage
- Have short (two paragraphs) "popular-history" text for each card when selected
- Have "card of the day" show-cased when starting a game

Historical stages, each with their own decks, are:
1. Kingdom
2. Early and mid Republic
3. Late Republic
4. Early Empire
5. Mid and late Empire

## Learning curve and progression:
1. Start simple (kingdom, stage 1): only 2 cards for money and army each, cards have only basic effects 
2. Increase strategic complexity (republic, stages 2-3): 3 cards for money and army each, some advanced effects
3. Increase management overhead (empire, stages 3-4): additional 3 "provisions" cards, complex effects

## Gameplay

Resource Types:
- During an encounter: Money, Army
- Carries over between encounters: Gold

Card types:
- Resource cards: provide Money or Army units
- Action cards: Perform special actions like drawing more cards, gaining additional actions, or providing bonuses.

Map:
- Encounters in a node graph
- Player progresses bottom-to-top

Encounter types:
- **Event**: Specific requirements or challenges that need to be overcome using Money or Army.
- **Battle**: Defeat enemy cards by reducing their Money or Army stat to zero.
- **Shop**: Spend Gold to buy new cards or upgrades.
- **Rest**: Recover resources or draw additional cards.
- **Treasure**: Gain valuable rewards or rare cards.

### Encounter Mechanics
Each battle and some events have cards that need to be destroyed to win.

Example cards:
- **"Army Provisions"**: Requires 2 Money to overcome.
- **"Building Materials"**: Requires 3 Money.
- **"Civil Unrest"**: Requires 1 Army units.
- **"Military Escort"**: Requires 2 Army units.

### Prayers Mechanic
Cost:
  - **Gold**: Prayers could cost Gold.
  - **Resource Cards**: Prayers could be triggered by sacrificing Money or Army cards from the hand.
  - **Sacrificing Cards**: Players could sacrifice any card to perform a prayer.

Effects:
  - **Additional Actions**: Gain more actions to play more cards in a turn.
  - **Draw More Cards**: Draw additional cards.
  - **Replace a Card**: Discard and draw a new card.

### Pressure Mechanics
- Card Trashing: After each turn, one random card from the player's deck is permanently trashed for the rest of the encounter.
- Scaling Enemy: A specific card gains stats each turn, forcing the player to destroy it quickly.

Five levels:
1. Kingdom
2. Early/mid republic

4. Early empire
5. mid/late empire

More: Seven Hills, First Aquaduct, Origins (Troy, Alba Longa), Pater Familias

Maybe: Divide history cards into two periods, so they are not completely random - then second period cards could be more challenging for example
